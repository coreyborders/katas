# Austin's Notes


Thank you for making this a public repo! Much easier for me to review, and gives that sweet sweet github cred

Mockito seems like a smell. Why is it needed?

Pay attention to squigglies, they usually help you write better code.

Tests pass in ide but not in the terminal, looks like you'd need to add a test platform. (See build.gradle for comments)
